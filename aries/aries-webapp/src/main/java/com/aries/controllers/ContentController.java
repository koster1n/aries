You have already damaged the relationship immediately by having an extreme reaction, which can leave you vulnerable further on in the negotiation process. Can you think of an example where your reaction might have ruined a negotiation? \n\n" +

The tendency here might be to hit back and forth with offensive comments to prove each party is right.  Have you been caught in this cycle? \n\n" +
				"3. Their Position: Instead of working at the problem together to improve your individual interests in a mutually beneficial way, the other party just want what they want, and it’s about convincing you. Their position, and framing of the negotiation process is guiding you’re lopsided attempt at negotiation! \n\n" +

You might be working towards a goal that could be mutually beneficial, but because the ideas and suggestions are coming from supposed negotiating partner won’t accept them.

From here, you’ll be able to refine your interests and see where compromise can be made. You need to determine their “perception” of the issues at stake, no matter what the “facts” to you might be.

					+ "B) Do not focus on a single solution: It is easy to idealize the perfect solution into the “only” solution, and start to criticize any options that defy this. However, this doesn’t lead to any solution-based approach to negotiation. In order to do this, you must be willing to accept and think about another option as feasible.\n\n"
					+ "C) Standards: In order for both sides to be happy we need to think about how to divide up what has just been discussed. Interests of both parties are on the table, and now how do both parties agree on something?\n\n"
					+ "1.     “Contest of Wills”: In many cases, Ury (2007) indicates that a contest of wills will occur. Both parties hold their position until the, most likely, weaker party decides to give in. If this occurs, most likely the relationship will be broken between them, as one side has been burned by the negotiation. Future negotiations and relations will be strained, and many may say the negotiation failed."
					+ "2.     Fair Standards: In order to avoid the contest of wills, successful negotiators will attempt to avoid this, and try to come up with options and solutions that benefit and satisfy both parties interests. Fair standards are rules that are universal to a fair outcome, regardless of each party’s interests.\n\n"
					+ "3.     Examples of “Fair Standards”: Ury (2007) gives are Market values, the law, precedent, and equal standards. Examples: For example, if you were to be negotiating a salary increase with your boss, you may survey the average market value of your position to levy your position with “fair standards”. Even if you don’t get the exact salary increase to that specific market value, you may get something of equal value that is of benefit to both you and the employer.");

					+"This is the best possible alternative if the negotiations aren’t meeting your interests, and the other party is not willing to compromise. It is not always beneficial to concede merely to reach an agreement, if your interests are not met, sometimes your best alternative might be to leave the negotiations. You keep your BATNA in your back pocket- it is the key to your power in a negotiation. The other party may or may not be able to predict your BATNA, and depending on their interests in you or your party, it may influence them to compromise on their interests in return."	 
					+"B)   How do we identify our BATNA? :"					 
					+"Ury (2007) identifies three types of alternatives to consider when identifying BATNA:\n\n"
					+"1.     Can you satisfy your interests without the help of the other party? (Ex. Walking out, another supplier, etc.).\n\n"
					+"2.     Is there anything you could do to make the other party respect your interests? (Ex: Strike, stopping trade, etc.)\n\n"
					+"3.     Can a third party be brought in to advance your interests in negotiation? (Ex: court, mediation, etc.)\n\n"
					 
					+"Your BATNA will be the key to power in negotiations. As discussed previously, if you are a union negotiating a bargaining agreement with your employer, for those who are able to, the BATNA may be to strike, and the employer will likely be able to predict this – Ex. Canadian Union of Postal Workers Vs. Federal Government.\n\n"
					+"C)   Boost your BATNA:\n\n"
					+"It is possible that in a situation you might have a weak BATNA. You can take steps to improve this. The example Ury (2007) uses is if your BATNA in wage negotiations is to start looking for another job, maybe you need to actively search and find a job offer before you enter the negotiations, in order to boost your BATNA. Another example might be if you are a producer working with one of your suppliers to lower their price on a specific commodity. You know the market price is much lower, and your BATNA is to possibly move to another supplier. To boost your BATNA, have an alternative supplier lined up that supplies at the price you are after.\n\n"
					+"D)   Decide if you should Negotiate:\n\n"
					+"In the example of the producer and supplier, you might have been working with supplier A for over a year to lower their price, and no matter how much you boost your BATNA, they still won’t budge. It might be that your BATNA is your best option, and you walk away from supplier A to supplier B, who has more reasonable prices.\n\n"
					+"A negotiation may continue to be beneficial only if your interests can still be satisfied. If you can do that without negotiating with the other party, you might be better off. However, as in the previous example, it could be that switching suppliers all together would have its costs. Perhaps supplier B is slower and people have complained they don’t receive their shipments on time; or possibly, Supplier B is cheaper on some commodities, but actually more expensive on other items. All of these factors may go into your decision to either negotiate further with Supplier A, or move on to your BATNA at Supplier B\n\n"
					+"E)   Identify their BATNA: \n\n"
					 
					+"You can identify many aspects of what you think might be the other sides BATNA. Is it weak or strong? Will/can they walk away? Will they change vendors? Depending on your interests, you may want the other party to continue negotiations and come to an agreement, rather than walking away.  In this case, you want to identify their BATNA so you can combat this, and develop a superior alternative. Identifying the other sides BATNA may be difficult- their may be times when the other party wants you to know their BATNA as leverage in negotiations, and other times, where they want to keep this a secret. Either way, doing everything reasonably possible to identify their BATNA will help you satisfy your interests as well.");

					+"We have developed solid foundation on how options and alternatives are shaped and formed to meet your interests and the other party’s interests. In order to develop an exceptional proposal, you want to exceed the benefits of both your BATNA and the other side’s BATNA, and meets fair standards. If this doesn’t occur, reasonably, one would conclude that either you or the other party will turn to your BATNA and a proposal would not be met. Ury (2007) identifies three proposals to consider when forming one for yourself:\n\n" 
					+"1.     What do you aspire to?\n\n"
					+"If we have low-aspiring goals when going into the negotiation, there will be a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy that will likely be fulfilled. “Aspirations” must be kept within the bounds of reality of course, but they need to be aspiring. You need to meld both interests to see the best possible solution for the future.\n\n"
					+"2.     What would you be content with?\n\n"
					+"This is fairly straightforward. What would you be “okay” with? Is there a solution that will satisfy the bottom line interests so that an agreement could be made. Likely this will still be better than your BATNA.\n\n"
					+"3.     What could you live with?\n\n"
					+"This would be directly related to your BATNA. Is there a proposal that has marginal differences that still makes it slightly better than your BATNA? This also could be worse than you BATNA, and if this is in your proposal, it’s possible you may want to walk away entirely.");
