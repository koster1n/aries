    Scenario: Suppose you are Government of Saskatchewan employee with the Ministry of Justice as a term worker. Currently there is a hiring freeze, which does not necessarily translate into a wage freeze quite yet. Your yearly review is coming up, and you have noticed that you outperform some of the more senior staff that have been there quite a bit longer, and get paid quite bit more. Your current hourly wage is $27.00/hour, but you feel your work should be valued at least at $32.00/hr. Ideally, you would prefer to be at the max of your salary rage which is $35.00. The increase in salary would make you feel more secure in your place at work and allow you the additional funds for savings for travelling, buying a house, etc. However, as a term employee you feel insecure in your current position, and as an alternative to a wage increase, you would take a permanent position to increase job security and sick/vacation time. You may have another opportunity lined up with Social Services that pays more, but it is not a permanent and is not secured yet.
    Your BATNA: Push the issue with your boss and leave your job to pursue other opportunities if your needs are not met. 
    This chatbox is your boss Jim. You are at your yearly review, and you have done exceptionally. You now need to bring up the “difficult conversation”  of compensation and begin the negotiation.
